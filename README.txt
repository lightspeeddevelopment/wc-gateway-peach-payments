== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What does this plugin do? =
A payment gateway integration between WooCommerce and Peach Payments.
= I’m getting a message about SSL not being enabled. =
Peach Payments does not require you to have an SSL certificate, because card details are only ever submitted to Peach Payments through SSL. However, some browsers may deliver a warning message when the connection changes between your non-SSL WooCommerce shop and the Peach Payments card entry form. For this reason, we recommend that you get an SSL certificate. You do not, however; need to deal with sorting out PCI compliancy, as this all on handled on the Peach Payments side.
= Test card should be authorized but I get the message: “Unfortunately your order cannot be processed as the originating bank/merchant has declined your transaction.” =
This might be caused by the fact that you are using an older version of the Peach Payments extension. Make sure that your Peach Payments extension has been updated and that you have the latest version. Then try using the test card again to see if it works.
= Visa card, Master card, American Express or other card not working. =
If a particular card brand is not working, make sure that you have enabled it using the “Supported Cards” field in the WooCommerce Checkout Settings for Peach Payments.
